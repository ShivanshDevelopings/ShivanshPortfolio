        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate and detail-oriented front-end developer with a love for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. With a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I craft websites that are not only beautiful but also responsive and optimized for great user experience across all devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey began with a strong curiosity for web design and coding, which grew into a professional pursuit. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code, and I continually strive to improve my skills by working on diverse projects. I enjoy turning ideas into reality through innovative design and flawless execution. Whether it's a sleek bakery website, a task manager app, or a personal portfolio, I aim to deliver high-quality solutions tailored to the needs of my clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with industry trends. If you're looking for a dedicated web developer who values precision, creativity, and usability, feel free to reach out!
